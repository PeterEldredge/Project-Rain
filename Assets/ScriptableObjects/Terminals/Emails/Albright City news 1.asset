  _content: "For the third time this month, the Yokomarra industrial complex fell
    silent as workers continued their string of organized walk outs. \r\n\r\nA demonstration
    was also made outside of CT Industries headquarters, as protesters held signs
    and chanted for better working conditions and more responsibility from the company.
    This comes right off the heels of the disaster at Wylder Power Plant, where a
    reactor explosion killed 57, and set the neighboring town ablaze. CT President
    Porter Croyle has yet to respond directly, but many believe his silence is clear
    enough. \r\n\r\nPolice were called to disperse the crowd and no arrests were made.
    \r\n\r\n"
