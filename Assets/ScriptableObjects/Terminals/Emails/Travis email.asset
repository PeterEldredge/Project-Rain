  _content: "Hey,\r\n\r\nI hope you\u2019ve been thinking about what I said. \r\n\r\nI
    know it may seem like a lot, but joining the cause is one of the best decisions
    I\u2019ve ever made. It\u2019s a chance to be a part of something bigger than
    yourself. These are great people, fighting for us to be treated like actual human
    beings. I know your mom\u2019s death has been hard on you, but I must remind you
    that it was the government who put her in that situation in the first place. They
    just want to control us. And I for one, am tired of having no say in how I live
    my life. \r\n\r\nI spoke with my superiors, and they informed me that there should
    be a precinct up near your tenant complex. Give them a chance, will you? If not
    for me or your mom, do it for yourself.\r\n\r\nStay Strong,\r\n                         Travis.\r\n"
