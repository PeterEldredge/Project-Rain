  _content: "Maren keeps losing control whenever someone visits the shop, and then
    I get a bad rap for it. I barely have any customers as is, and now even the few
    I could rely on have stopped showing up. \r\n\r\nI never should have gone with
    that TL-3 core when installing her internal processor. It was cheaper then, but
    not worth it in the long run. I\u2019ve tried replacing it, but she never understands
    and just assumes I\u2019m trying to hurt her.\r\n\r\nOne of these days I actually
    might. \r\n\r\nThe last time she short circuited, she went ballistic and startled
    nearly every tenant in the complex. If we didn\u2019t live in such an isolated
    shit hole, I would have been arrested on sight. \r\n\r\nI love her to death, but
    I can\u2019t make a living without any paying customers.\r\n"
